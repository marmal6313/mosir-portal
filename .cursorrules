# Protect Gantt files from automatic refactors.
In files matching:
- components/GanttChart.tsx
- app/dashboard/gantt/page.tsx

Rules:
- Do not rename or change exports.
- Keep the named export `GanttChart` and the type `GanttItem`.
- Do not reorder React hooks, do not wrap hooks in conditionals.
- Do not add or remove framer-motion imports automatically.
- Only modify these files if I explicitly ask: "edit gantt".
